# Tariff Warfront

**Global Tariff Impact Tracker & Educational Analytics Platform**

I developed a full-stack platform for real-time trade policy analysis and public insight delivery. Built with Next.js and NestJS, the application aggregates live tariff data from official sources like the USTR and WTO, integrating it with real-time market indicators to provide a unified view of policy impact. I designed and implemented interactive dashboards featuring maps, graphs, and AI-generated summaries to help policymakers, educators, and researchers quickly grasp complex trade shifts. To streamline information consumption, I integrated natural language summarization models that condense over 1,000 daily updates into actionable insights to reduce plicy research times. The platform was built to serve both technical and non-technical audiences, with customizable visualizations and exportable reports for stakeholder communication.

## üöß Project Status & What‚Äôs Next

**Today (v0.3 Alpha)**  
- The live **dashboard, map, and time‚Äëseries charts** are up and running with hourly tariff feeds from WTO, USTR, and USITC.  
- AI summaries are generated via the OpenAI‚ÄØGPT‚Äë4 API, giving one‚Äësentence context for each new policy event.  

**In Progress (Shipping Soon)**  
- **Trend‚Äëforecast module:** we‚Äôre integrating a PyTorch + TensorFlow Lite model to predict sector‚Äëlevel tariff impacts 30‚ÄØdays out, so users can see ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs likely next.‚Äù  
- **Enhanced NLP:** migrating the quick‚Äësummary pipeline to a compact TensorFlow text model for faster, on‚Äëdevice inference (edge caching).  
- **User watchlists & alert rules:** subscribe to specific HS codes, countries, or sectors and receive instant email/SMS notifications.  

Stay tuned‚Äînew features drop every two weeks, and you can follow progress on the¬†[roadmap board](../../projects) or open an issue to request a feature.
